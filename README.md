## Frequently Asked Questions (for bedrock players)
Q: _Why does it say "Tried to log in as a Java player" when I try to join?_
A: The server does that sometimes, try again.

Q: _Why does it say that the world is closed?_
A: The server is either not running, or you may be unable to connect somehow. Try joining BCMain if you tried to join simga143.

Q: _Why does it say "Outdated client"?_
A: Your Minecraft version isn't the most recent one. Update it.

Q: _Why am I lagging so much?_
A: You'll occasionally lag in the first few minutes of joining.

Q: _I disconnected randomly._
A: Either my internet went out or you lagged too much, try checking your internet connection. Also that's not a question.
## Silly things about the server
- There is a map you can open in your web browser (you can send messages through this too). Go to [147.185.221.25:46994](147.185.221.25:46994)
- You can sit on stuff, press place on most slabs/stairs (or players) with an empty hand to do so, or run /sit.
- There are custom images in the game in the form of maps. If you want a picture uploaded just send it to me and tell me the size (eg 2x2 or 3x4)
- TPA system: you can request teleports to another player by running /tpa {player name}
- You can occasionally get mob heads when you kill a mob
- Item names can be formatted using [MiniMessage](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html) formatting
- I made a custom plugin that does something special when you sleep :)
